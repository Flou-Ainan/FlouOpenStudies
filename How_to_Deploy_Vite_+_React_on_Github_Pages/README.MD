# How to Deploy a Vite + React Project on Github Pages

I'm assuming a couple of things here, if you aint got them go there and do or get them before. 
## Assumptions
- You already have Node and npm installed in your machine. I reccomend using nvm to control the node versions.
- You already have VScode installed in your machine and know hot to use it.
- You know Vite or at least his weaker brother (my opinon) CreateReactApp
- You already understand at least a little bit of Github, React and the overall webdev context.

## Step 1
<h4>Create a React Boilerplate app with Vite</h4>

Open your terminal on your preferred projects folder
